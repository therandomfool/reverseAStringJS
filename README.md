# Reverse A String JS 

- Coded Three Different Ways
- 1. String changed to Array using split()
-    use .reverse() to reverse array 
-    use .join() to changed reveresed array back to string;

- 2. Using the same methods as #1 but...
-    chaining the methods togehter in an one line return statement

- 3. Without JS methods going old skool
-    using a decending for loop
-    += each letter backwards into a new string and returning
